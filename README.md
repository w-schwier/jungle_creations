Jungle Creations - Back End Technical Test.
Brief:
Over the phone I have explained to you that we aim to build an internal system that will collect ,
store and aggregate data from multiple sources, to then hopefully create a dynamic reporting
and analytics platform.
Objective​:
We would like you to build a simple restful API using NodeJS that interacts with facebook's
graph API, the interactions can be a simple. We would then like you to to make 2 separate calls
and aggregate the data in a MongoDB.
What the alls do and are are completely up to you.
This exercise is to get a better understanding of your ability to create Restful APIs with standard
interactions with open 3rd party API’s, and store a set of data in a Database.
You may use any additional frameworks you deem necessary, if you can not complete the task
or get stuck let us know.
Once completed please upload github, bitbucket or similar, with instruction on how to interact
with it.
Bonus points:
Host the API on a cloud hosting platform.
